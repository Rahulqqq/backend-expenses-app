## Daily Expenses Sharing Application Backend

  ## Project Overview
  This project provides the backend for a daily expenses sharing application. Users can manage expenses and split them with friends using three different methods: equal, exact amounts, and percentage-based splits. The backend handles user management, expense tracking, and provides functionality to generate balance sheets in Excel or PDF formats.

  ## Features
  1. User Management: Create and retrieve users.
  2. Expense Management: Add expenses and split them using:
      - Equal Split
      - Exact Amounts
      - Percentage-based Split
3. Balance Sheet: Generate and download a balance sheet in Excel or PDF.
4. Validation: Ensure input correctness (e.g., percentages add up to 100%).
